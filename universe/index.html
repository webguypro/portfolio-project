         <h3>The Proton <span> "He was in the beginning with God"</span></h3>
         <p>The Universe wanted to experience itself subjectively, so it conjured up a subatomic particle that we named the <STRONG>"Proton"</STRONG>.  <br>This Proton was the <STRONG>Father</STRONG> of the King, the first thought ever conjured up by Oneness.</src></p>
         <h3>The Neutron<span> "All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made"</span></h3>
         <p>Another seed was introduced which was the seed or Son of the Father.  We have named this particle the <STRONG>"Neutron"</STRONG>. <br>Now the <STRONG>Son</STRONG> was one with the Father Proton.  This was the beginning of thinking.</p>
         <h3>The Electron<span> "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men"</h3>
         <p>The notion of thinking took the form of motion, vibrations and energy.<br>Without this motion and energy, the proton and neutron would lay dormant,
         nothing more than thought without purpose.<br>The <STRONG>Spirit</STRONG> that surrounds the electron has a negative charge and is a particle we have named the <STRONG>"Electron"</STRONG></p>

    <h1>Our Universe is Awake!</h1>
  <p>Thus, consciousness was born through motion to experience itself subjectively.<br> We can experience this ancient perception of <STRONG>Oneness</STRONG> in our daily lives...</p>
